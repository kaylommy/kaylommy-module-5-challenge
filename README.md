# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Descriptipn
This weeks homework assignment was to clone the starter code and make everything function properly. The save button would save user input into the local storage and display it on the screen. The time blocks should have a color corresponding with the current hour, past is grey, future is green, and present is red. When the page is refreshed the saved user input should still display on the screen.
